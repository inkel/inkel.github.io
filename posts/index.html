    <p>One thing I&rsquo;ve found fairly often in Go programs is people checking if an environment variable is defined by using the <a href="https://pkg.go.dev/os#LookupEnv"><code>os.LookupEnv</code></a> function, that returns a string with the value, and a boolean indicating that the variable is present. However, what most people seem to miss is the comment that the returned value might still be empty!</p>
<p>Take for instance the following program that you can try in <a href="https://play.golang.org/p/o_5qRCF62BR">the Go Playground</a>:</p>
<pre tabindex="0"><code>package main

import (
	&quot;fmt&quot;
	&quot;os&quot;
)

func main() {
	os.Setenv(&quot;FOO&quot;, &quot;bar&quot;)
	printEnv(&quot;FOO&quot;)

	os.Setenv(&quot;FOO&quot;, &quot;&quot;)
	printEnv(&quot;FOO&quot;)

	os.Unsetenv(&quot;FOO&quot;)
	printEnv(&quot;FOO&quot;)

}

func printEnv(v string) {
	ge := os.Getenv(v)
	le, ok := os.LookupEnv(v)
	fmt.Printf(&quot;Getenv(%[1]q) =&gt; %[2]q\nLookupEnv(%[1]q) =&gt; (%[3]q, %[4]t)\n\n&quot;, v, ge, le, ok)
}
</code></pre><p>If you run this, the results might not be what you were expecting:</p>
<pre tabindex="0"><code>Getenv(&quot;FOO&quot;) =&gt; &quot;bar&quot;
LookupEnv(&quot;FOO&quot;) =&gt; (&quot;bar&quot;, true)

Getenv(&quot;FOO&quot;) =&gt; &quot;&quot;
LookupEnv(&quot;FOO&quot;) =&gt; (&quot;&quot;, true)

Getenv(&quot;FOO&quot;) =&gt; &quot;&quot;
LookupEnv(&quot;FOO&quot;) =&gt; (&quot;&quot;, false)
</code></pre><p>Now you know: the proper way to check an environment variable os it use <code>os.LookupEnv</code> and check both the boolean and that the string isn&rsquo;t empty, otherwise you might introduce a bug in your program.</p>
<p>PS: how cool is that you can refer to arguments in a formatting string using their position?</p>

<p>Long story short: just run <code>go mod edit -replace path/to/module=/absolute/local/path</code> and you&rsquo;re good to go! Now when you compile your Go project it will be using the changes in your local environment and not those published in Go module registry.</p>

    <p>Recently <a href="/posts/hello-grafana-labs/">I&rsquo;ve changed jobs</a>, and that meant, among many other things, that my work email address changed, which means that my commits are now using the wrong email address! I need to fix that, but of course I&rsquo;ve already committed stuff using my old email address. How can I fix that?</p>
<p>Luckily the solution isn&rsquo;t difficult, though it took me a while to properly figure it out.</p>
<p>The first thing I needed to do was to configure my repository to use my work email address:</p>
<pre tabindex="0"><code>path/to/work-repo $ git config user.name &quot;Leandro López (inkel)&quot;
path/to/work-repo $ git config user.email &quot;work@example.com&quot;
</code></pre><p>Note that I&rsquo;m doing this only for my work related repositories, so all of my other work (e.g. public or open source) uses my personal email address.</p>
<p>Next I want to know which commits SHA1s are using my personal email address. I can use the<a href="http://git-scm.com/docs/git-log#Documentation/git-log.txt---authorltpatterngt"> <code>--author</code> flag of <code>git-log(1)</code></a> and get that information easily:</p>
<pre tabindex="0"><code>$ git log --pretty=format:&quot;%h - %aN &lt;%ae&gt; - %s&quot; --abbrev-commit --author=personal@example.com
86b860dcc - inkel &lt;personal@example.com&gt; - Use stringSet for collecting child modules
9822062a9 - inkel &lt;personal@example.com&gt; - Use stringSet for collecting top root modules
d6d397f3c - inkel &lt;personal@example.com&gt; - Add stringSet type to collect unique set of strings
</code></pre><p>Now what I want to do is to reset the author to use the one I configured for this repository without editing the commit message; additionally I want to add a <code>Signed off by</code> line at the end of each commit message. One way to do this is to manually execute the following for every commit:</p>
<pre tabindex="0"><code>$ git commit --amend --signoff --author=&quot;Leandro López (inkel) &lt;work@example.com&gt;&quot; $COMMITSHA
</code></pre><p>But as you can figure out, this becomes tedious if you have multiple commits. So let&rsquo;s use the power of <a href="http://git-scm.com/docs/git-rebase"><code>git-rebase(1)</code></a> and automate this:</p>
<pre tabindex="0"><code>$ git rebase --exec='git commit --no-edit --amend -s --reset-author' d6d397f3c^
Executing: git commit --no-edit --amend -s --reset-author
[detached HEAD f29b70ad2] Add stringSet type to collect unique set of strings
 2 files changed, 120 insertions(+)
 create mode 100644 docker/terraform/automation/stringset.go
 create mode 100644 docker/terraform/automation/stringset_test.go
Executing: git commit --no-edit --amend -s --reset-author

 1 file changed, 7 insertions(+), 21 deletions(-)
Executing: git commit --no-edit --amend -s --reset-author
[detached HEAD 5d168a566] Use stringSet to collect modules
 1 file changed, 3 insertions(+), 14 deletions(-)
Successfully rebased and updated refs/heads/foo.
</code></pre><p>And that&rsquo;s it! All the commits got fixed to use my work email address instead.</p>
<h2 id="what-is-going-on-lets-dig-into-it">What is going on?! Let&rsquo;s dig into it</h2>
<p>First is the <a href="http://git-scm.com/docs/git-rebase"><code>--exec</code> flag</a>. This tells Git that for the given list of commits it needs to execute that command <strong>after</strong> each commit. In this case the command to execute is <code>git commit --no-edit --amend -s --reset-author</code> which amends the commit (<code>--amend</code>) without changing the commit message (<code>--no-edit</code>) except by adding a <code>Signed off by</code> line at the end of the message (<code>-s</code> which is short for <code>--signoff</code>) and changing the author to the one this repository should use (<code>--reset-author</code>, remember we add a custom configuration for it).</p>
<p>Then comes the commit list, in this case <code>d6d397f3c^</code>. Look again at the list of commits above. If you see, the SHA is the same as the one at the bottom of the list, which is the <em>first</em> commit of the list (they are shown in reverse order). The <code>^</code> at the end of the SHA instructs Git to go through the current list of commits until the <em>parent</em> of that commit, without including it.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s it! Once this is done, I pull the list of commits again and it looks right:</p>
<pre tabindex="0"><code>$ git log --pretty=format:&quot;%h - %aN &lt;%ae&gt; - %s (%cr)' --abbrev-commit --date=relative&quot; --author=work@example.com
5d168a566 - Leandro López (inkel) &lt;work@example.com&gt; - Use stringSet for collecting child modules
3ca17042b - Leandro López (inkel) &lt;work@example.com&gt; - Use stringSet for collecting top root modules
f29b70ad2 - Leandro López (inkel) &lt;work@example.com&gt; - Add stringSet type to collect unique set of strings
</code></pre><p>This is a very particular use case, but what else we could do with it? Well, you can pass anything to the <code>exec</code> flag, not only Git commands, so you could say run your test suite for each commit and if the command fails then it will stop executing the rebase, allowing you to fix things before continuing. Definitely a very powerful tool to have in your toolbox!</p>

    <p>It’s been a while since my <a href="/posts/goodbye-theorem/">last post</a> here, not because I’m lazy (which I am), but because as you know I recently changed jobs. It’s been almost a month at my new place, and now I feel confident to say that I joined <a href="https://grafana.com/">Grafana Labs</a> as an SRE for the internal cloud platform!</p>
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">Today is my first day as an SRE at <a href="https://twitter.com/grafana?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">@grafana</a> !!! <a href="https://t.co/HMER6vcoNp">pic.twitter.com/HMER6vcoNp</a></p>&mdash; Lean (inkel) (@inkel) <a href="https://twitter.com/inkel/status/1366413070034173958?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">March 1, 2021</a></blockquote>
<script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script>

<p>For most of my career I worked as a backend developer, only dabbling sporadically into an operations role, so I would be lying if I said that impostor syndrome didn&rsquo;t kick in during my first few days at this new role, but luckily my team is super friendly, helping, and understanding, and my confidence is getting bigger as days pass. I think I made the right decision deciding to jump into this new adventure.</p>
<p>Switching jobs is never easy, specially after almost a decade at my previous work, and thus some of my schedules were affected, like the weekly cadence of <a href="https://buttondown.email/inkel">newsletter</a> or writing into this blog. I hope to get back into rhythm soon.</p>
<p>This past month I&rsquo;ve spent it mostly going through the onboarding process, getting to know my team, some other teams' leaders, and familiarizing with the codebase and tools like <a href="https://grafana.com/oss/grafana/">Grafana</a>, <a href="https://grafana.com/oss/loki/">Loki</a>, and <a href="https://grafana.com/oss/tanka/">Tanka</a>. And I&rsquo;ve even found the time to add a <a href="https://github.com/google/go-jsonnet/pull/525">performance contribution</a> to a third-party library!</p>
<p>There are still lots of things to learn, but for now I&rsquo;ll  continue to learn more about this amazing company and the work I&rsquo;ll be doing, improving my skills, and learning a few more tricks. The future looks really bright!</p>

    <p>Today is my final day at <a href="https://theorem.co/">Theorem</a> after almost 10 years. It is a day full of mixed feelings for me, as I&rsquo;m excited for what&rsquo;s waiting for me next week (more on that, well, next week) and I&rsquo;m saddened for leaving this amazing team of friendly and talented human beings.</p>
<p>When I joined the Citrusbyte, how it was named at the time, we were less than 20 people working in a hectic but fun and creative environment.  And while it might seem hard to believe, that same spirit is still around all these years later, although luckily is not (that) hectic anymore.</p>
<p>Not only the company grew throughout but so did I. I went from being a single guy who had just bought an apartment doing nothing more than programming and reading all day to a father of two and owner of a house. And this company always had my back because all of us employees are treated like people.</p>
<p>But I digress…</p>
<p>Yesterday I&rsquo;ve got a farewell Meet call with lots of teammates, and I would be lying if I wouldn&rsquo;t say that afterwards my ego was the size of a continent, I&rsquo;m happy and proud of leaving a mark on Citrusbyte/Theorem&rsquo;s culture, and I will forever be grateful and honoured for this past decade. And who knows, maybe someday I&rsquo;ll return with new tricks to share.</p>

    <p>It&rsquo;s finally over. This awful year has ended. My work life <a href="https://inkel.github.io/posts/typical-workday-at-theorem/">hasn&rsquo;t changed much</a>, although I had to <a href="https://inkel.github.io/posts/work-blocks/">organize my work blocks</a> in a better way. My personal life, on the other hand, was quite affected, specially for my kids and partner; they were the most affected by having to start kindergarden classes via Zoom (my kids), and almost completely stop they work life (my partner).</p>
<p>I did manage to do some stuff that I find nice to share, and hopefully will continue doing in 2021:</p>
<ul>
<li>I dedicated more time to this blog again.</li>
<li>I have a <a href="https://buttondown.email/inkel" title="inkelinks">newsletter</a> now; please go and subscribe!</li>
<li>For the first time in my life I joined the <a href="https://inkel.github.io/posts/adventofcode-2020/">Advent of Code</a>, although for different reasons I&rsquo;ve stopped working on the challenges; I&rsquo;m planning on continue with them in my upcoming vacations.</li>
</ul>
<p>I don&rsquo;t believe in <em>magical dates</em> and I know it&rsquo;s not that January 1st, 2021 will be automatically better: COVID-19 still exists, travel is restricted, the economy in this country (Argentina) isn&rsquo;t getting any better, etc, but I&rsquo;m looking forward to see what the new year will bring and work on making things better, not only for me, but for my family.</p>

    <p>I had a very busy couple of days at work, so I couldn&rsquo;t get too much done in Advent of Code. Working on day 7 took me a while to figure out the <a href="https://github.com/inkel/adventofcode-2020/blob/5300bc3ad6936f39a2d027050b5b32ecf5dba577/src/adventofcode_2020/day7.clj">solution</a>, specially in part 2. But I did it.</p>
<p>I think the biggest issue that I faced was that I was still trying to think in terms of procedural programming and not functional programming. I&rsquo;m definitely not happy with the solution, again <a href="https://github.com/inkel/adventofcode-2020/blob/5300bc3ad6936f39a2d027050b5b32ecf5dba577/src/adventofcode_2020/day7.clj#L55-L60">specially part 2</a>, but it works. I&rsquo;m definitely looking forward to start refactoring the code and looking for better solutions.</p>

    <p>So far these are the challenges that I liked the most, I think. Also, a feeling that I&rsquo;ve been having lately was that the code is a mess (to be expected because I&rsquo;m learning) and this particular <a href="https://github.com/inkel/adventofcode-2020/blob/9d2a63040272bf79338680d51ad1c6765aa67703/src/adventofcode_2020/day6.clj">day&rsquo;s solutions</a> showed me exactly that: there are lots of refactorings to apply that will make the code more reusable and maintainable. I don&rsquo;t plan on doing that yet, but it&rsquo;s likely I&rsquo;ll do it in the upcoming days.</p>

<p>One thing that I always knew <strong>theoretically</strong> but now I can confirm because of working with it the last few days is that the level of expressiveness is astonishing. I was very comfortable when I was programming in <a href="https://www.ruby-lang.org/en/">Ruby</a> because I felt that it was too easy to translate my thoughts into code, but I&rsquo;ve got to confess that while I&rsquo;m nowhere near that level of comfort, I&rsquo;m liking it more and more as each day passes.</p>

    <p>Last night I solved day 4 part 1 of the <a href="https://adventofcode.com/2020/">Advent of Code 2020</a> challenge, and this morning I finally solved part 2, thus <a href="https://github.com/inkel/adventofcode-2020/blob/4d050447311b70d4dd99b8214a14c7c3039afe17/src/adventofcode_2020/day4.clj">solving day 4</a> completely.

<p>I feel more confident as each day passes, and I&rsquo;m getting more proficient with the environment as well. I hope that by the end of Advent of Code I feel confident enough to try Clojure in a small project at <a href="https://theorem.co/">work</a>.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;m getting more familiar with Clojure, and the tools I use for this project: <a href="https://leiningen.org">Leiningen</a>, Emacs + <a href="https://github.com/clojure-emacs/cider">CIDER</a>. About the latter, I know I could be more efficient if I knew the commands better, but so far it is really useful and I&rsquo;m not only learning tons but also in awe as to how well integrated this tool is.</p>

<p>As said in my <a href="https://inkel.github.io/posts/adventofcode-2020/">previous post</a> one of the reasons why I&rsquo;m participating in this years <a href="https://adventofcode.com/2020">Advent of Code</a> is because I want to learn <a href="https://clojure.org/">Clojure</a>, and while at times I felt frustrated because I couldn&rsquo;t find the solution, I&rsquo;m happy that I did. As with everything, in hindsight, the solution is obvious now. Not that while the problems were similar, both solutions are quite different, and I think they showcase my improvement with the language and functional way of thinking.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m looking forward to Day 2 challenges, and I hope to solve them in less than four days!</p>

    <p>For years I&rsquo;ve been a fan of the idea behind <a href="https://adventofcode.com/">Advent of Code</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>…an Advent calendar of small programming puzzles for a variety of skill sets and skill levels that can be solved in any programming language you like.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>For a variety of reasons I&rsquo;ve neglected participating in <a href="https://adventofcode.com/2020/events">past editions</a>, but this year I&rsquo;ve finally decided to give it a try.</p>
<p>The biggest reason behind the decision to join this year was that for the longest time I had the desire to become proficient in any of the many LISP languages out there, particularly in <a href="https://clojure.org/">Clojure</a>, so I saw this as a chance to get more familiar with it, learn something more about it, and having fun while doing so.</p>
<p>There are already 2 puzzles going on, and I haven&rsquo;t even started, but when I do I also plan to publish everything into my <a href="https://github.com/inkel/">GitHub account</a>.</p>

    <p>For years I disliked playing games. Never before in my life I had a gaming console, and the last game I played from start to end was The Secret of Monkey Island. But a couple of years ago I decided to buy a PlayStation 4 and I&rsquo;m extremely happy with that decision. The main reason was of course to start playing myself, but also to raise my kids in a house where gaming is &ldquo;normal&rdquo;.</p>
<p>Why did I wait so long?!</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t think I&rsquo;m a hardcore gamer, not even close, but since I bought my PS4 I play at least one hour almost every night, as a way of cooling off my mind before going to bed. I find it very relaxing and entertaining. I mostly play solo games, the idea of working online with others doesn&rsquo;t attract me, as I take this time as a <em>me time</em> and I don&rsquo;t want to engage with others. I know that I&rsquo;m missing lots of fun, or so I&rsquo;ve been told, but I&rsquo;m happy with this decision.</p>
<p>Over the course of the upcoming months I&rsquo;ll try and leave some &ldquo;reviews&rdquo; on some of the games I played so far:</p>
<ul>
<li>Horizon: Zero Dawn</li>
<li>God of War</li>
<li>Uncharted Saga</li>
<li>The WItcher 3</li>
<li>Detroit: Becoming Human</li>
<li>Mass Effect: Andromeda</li>
<li>Spider-Man</li>
<li>Rise of the Tomb Raider</li>
<li>The Last of Us</li>
<li>Dragon Age: Inquisition</li>
</ul>
<p>I cannot finish this post without saying this: the very first game I played, <a href="https://www.guerrilla-games.com/play/horizon">Horizon: Zero Dawn</a>, I fell in love with the character, the world, and the story behind it:</p>

    <p>I always liked the interviews at <a href="https://usesthis.com/">Uses This</a>, I find it really interesting knowing other people&rsquo;s setups. And given that I do not foresee them interviewing me anytime soon, I went ahead and wrote my own.</p>
<h2 id="who-are-you-and-what-do-you-do">Who are you, and what do you do?</h2>
<p>I&rsquo;m Leandro López, better known on the Internet as <code>inkel</code> (all lowercase). I work as a software developer at <a href="https://theorem.co/">Theorem</a>, mostly doing backend programming but also dabbling in operations when needed. I&rsquo;m interested in programming as a science, machine learning, DevOps (whatever that means), and keeping systems running.</p>
<h2 id="what-hardware-do-you-use">What hardware do you use?</h2>
<p>My main machine is a MacBook Pro 2015 15&quot;, which I love. I&rsquo;ve also have a secondary Dell XPS with Windows 10. Meh.</p>
<p>I, like everyone else, do not like the new butterfly keyboard, and because of that I&rsquo;m using a <a href="https://www.keychron.com/products/keychron-k2-wireless-mechanical-keyboard?variant=31063869554777">Keychron K2</a> as an external, mechanical keyboard; I love this keyboard, it&rsquo;s clickly but not too loud, it can connect to up to 3 devices and seamlessly change from one to the other by pressing a couple keys. The only thing I miss in this keyboard is a Touch ID reader.</p>
<p>For a long while my hands travelled from the K2 to my MBP touchpad, and that was becoming tedious. I love the touchpad, but buying an external one was costly in Argentina, and thus I bought a trackball for the first time in my life, as I also wanted to give them a try. I&rsquo;ve got a <a href="https://www.logitech.com/en-us/product/mx-ergo-wireless-trackball-mouse">Logitech Ergo MX</a> and boy am I happy with it. It didn&rsquo;t take me too long to get used to it, and while it&rsquo;s not the same as the touchpad, it is customizable so I can do many things without leaving my hand off the trackball. Still, I would like for it to have a couple more buttons so I can customize it even more.</p>
<p>As I work in a 100% remote company, calls are something that happen almost daily. For that reason I use mostly <a href="https://www.apple.com/shop/product/MNHF2AM/A/earpods-with-35-mm-headphone-plug?fnode=2c1575ea1bbc6149fd197f885aa3792697d9f7902bff43198ab0e2ad4e045a31f2655938f05ab9b762b2afaf7ae7a9a74fb76b395966a5dc75bdda9d264a13ec932f3314d587e3a53d5a875498bfa64299a2338ed3cbce9f57fe6fe6f7e2794e8da738bd0d992e8f071f34bec2717a306c59d8ccbcb69f0d46b8a2c41ddd4e80">Apple EarPods</a>, they work just great. At my office I&rsquo;ve a pair of <a href="https://www.logitechg.com/en-us/products/gaming-audio/g533-wireless-gaming-headset.html">Logitech G533</a>, which sounds great and are wonderful, but have two main issues to my taste: 1. they are not Bluetooth, you need a USB receptor connected to your computer; 2. after 15 minutes of audio silence (i.e. no audio coming through the speakers), it powers off, which is troublesome if you are doing a presentation and the rest of the audience is muted; I&rsquo;ve already felt the pain of talking and talking and talking and people trying to tell me they couldn&rsquo;t hear me but I couldn&rsquo;t hear them either because the headset was off. Sad emoji. I&rsquo;ve also bought a pair of <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Philips-SHB3075-Wireless-Headphones-Playtime/dp/B07P8R3CTB">Philips SHB3075</a>, they are comfortable and 100% Bluetooth, but for some reason they don&rsquo;t work well with my MBP, so I&rsquo;ve them paired with my iPhone.</p>
<p>When mobile I use an iPhone 8, one that needs a change because my screen shattered. I started using iPhones since the iPhone 5 and never looked back. They are fast, pretty, and just work, as anything from Apple. Are they expensive? Yes. Are they worth it? Hell yes.</p>
<p>I prefer reading physical books than ebooks, nevertheless, I&rsquo;ve an iPad Mini mostly for just that. It&rsquo;s a great device with an excellent size for reading and taking from one place to another, without being a fullsized iPad.</p>
<p>Last but not least, as a developer I spend most of my days sitting, and I&rsquo;m over 40, so a good chair is more than just luxury. Because of that I own a <a href="https://www.erasmo.com.ar/productos/sillas/operativas/onix/">Erasmo Onix</a>, and my life (and back) has been happier ever since. I cannot stress enough how much I recommend to <strong>spend serious money on a good chair</strong>.</p>
<h2 id="and-what-software">And what software?</h2>
<p>On my main computer, macOS as the operative system. It&rsquo;s pretty, it works, it makes me happy. But I know I&rsquo;ve to upgrade to Catalina soon.</p>
<p>Given I&rsquo;m a developer, most of the things I write happens in <a href="https://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/">Emacs</a>. My <a href="https://github.com/inkel/emacs-d"><code>init.el</code></a> is far from perfect and I&rsquo;ve neglected updating it for a long time. Sometimes I use <a href="https://code.visualstudio.com/">Visual Studio Code</a> (VSCode) or <a href="https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/vs/mac/">Visual Studio for Mac</a>, but I always end up coming back to Emacs.</p>
<p>When I&rsquo;m not on Emacs, I spend most of my time in a few <a href="https://www.iterm2.com/">iTerm2</a> tabs. I&rsquo;ve tried other terminals like <a href="https://sw.kovidgoyal.net/kitty/">kitty</a>, and while much faster, it&rsquo;s definitely nowhere near in UX. Besides using tabs I also use <a href="https://github.com/tmux/tmux/wiki">tmux</a> a lot. A LOT. My <a href="https://github.com/inkel/dotfiles/blob/master/tmux.conf"><code>tmux.conf</code></a> is adequately updated to my tastes, although it could use some improvement. Yes, I&rsquo;ve heard about iTerm and tmux integration; no I haven&rsquo;t tried it. I use <a href="https://www.gnu.org/software/bash/">Bash</a>. I&rsquo;m super comfortable with it, so I&rsquo;m not looking to change to another shell in the short term.</p>
<p>Writing Markdown is something I find myself doing every so often, and for that, I use <a href="https://typora.io/">Typora</a>. It&rsquo;s beautiful, elegant, fast, I love it. I <strong>might</strong> switch to <a href="https://bear.app/">Bear</a>, though, as I&rsquo;ve been trying it on my cellphone and it works really well, even without the Pro features; I might upgrade to Pro soon, still haven&rsquo;t decided. This blog is using Typora for the content and <a href="https://gohugo.io/">Hugo</a> as the static site generator.</p>
<p>My other computer runs Windows 10. Windows as an operating system has improved a lot over the years, but it&rsquo;s still, in my opinion, not very developer friendly as an operating system. For writing code, <a href="https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/vs/">Visual Studio</a> is undoubtedly one of the best IDEs there is, although of course mostly tied to developing within the Microsoft platform. I also have VSCode installed: sometimes I just need something that loads fast for quick edits. <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/sql/ssms/sql-server-management-studio-ssms?view=sql-server-ver15">SQL Server Management Studio</a> is another great tool though it feels a bit dated.
CLI is where I feel Windows fails the most, and while the new <a href="https://devblogs.microsoft.com/commandline/windows-terminal-1-0/">Windows Terminal</a> looks promising, it still lacks the smooth UX that other terminal emulators like iTerm2 have. The <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Windows_Subsystem_for_Linux">Windows Subsystem for Linux</a> (WSL) is another great addition to CLI on Windows, but again, still a bit clunky.</p>
<p>Languages are varied: I really enjoy writing <a href="https://www.ruby-lang.org/en/">Ruby</a>, love toying with <a href="https://golang.org/">Go</a>, have enough fun to work with <a href="https://dotnet.microsoft.com/">.NET Core</a> and <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/csharp/">C#</a>. I like to have as much infrastructure as possible described using <a href="https://www.terraform.io/">Terraform</a>. And I really, really love writing scripts using Bash, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AWK">AWK</a>, <a href="https://www.gnu.org/software/sed/manual/sed.html">sed</a>, <a href="https://curl.haxx.se/">curl</a>, and <a href="https://stedolan.github.io/jq/">jq</a>.</p>
<p>Last but not least is The Cloud. Nothing surprising there: <a href="https://github.com/">GitHub</a> for <a href="https://github.com/inkel">own and Open Source code</a>, and some work related stuff. <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/">Amazon Web Services</a> and <a href="https://azure.com/">Microsoft Azure</a> for hosting stuff.</p>
<h2 id="what-would-be-your-dream-setup">What would be your dream setup?</h2>
<p>I&rsquo;d love to get my hands on one of the newer <a href="https://www.apple.com/macbook-pro-16/">MacBook Pro 16&quot;</a> with at least 32 GB of RAM and an SSD of at elast 1TB. I don&rsquo;t think I&rsquo;m going to try a new mechanical keyboard for the time being, but the <a href="https://www.keychron.com/pages/keychron-k8-wireless-mechanical-keyboard">Keychron K8</a> looks like a good future replacement. Similar with my mouse, I&rsquo;ll continue with my Logitech Ergo MX, but also looking forward to get an <a href="https://www.apple.com/shop/product/MRMF2/magic-trackpad-2-space-gray">Apple Magic Trackpad 2</a>.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;d like to improve my communications setup, probably by getting some <a href="https://www.apple.com/shop/product/MWP22/airpods-pro">AirPods Pro</a>, or a cool Bluetooth headset.</p>
<p>My office needs some love, and due to the Covid-19 pandemic I&rsquo;m not even going, but once back I&rsquo;d like to have one or two external monitors, and a good microphone. I don&rsquo;t have anything in mind yet, though.</p>
<p>As said my phone needs a change, and I&rsquo;m looking forward to buying an iPhone 11. I&rsquo;d also like to leave my computer at the office but still having something portable and comfortable at home where I can do some coding, and that&rsquo;s why I&rsquo;ve an <a href="https://www.apple.com/ipad-pro/">iPad Pro</a> in mind.</p>
<p>I want to have my office devices accessible from home, and thus I&rsquo;m looking at using <a href="https://tailscale.com/">Tailscale</a>. I&rsquo;ve only heard amazing things about them.</p>

  <section class="content">
    <p>After publishing my previous <a href="/posts/typical-workday-at-theorem/"><em>Working at Theorem: a typical workday</em></a> article a co-worker asked me the following:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Can you go into the details of what happens during those &ldquo;work&rdquo; blocks? Do you frequently check slack_email or only check them occasionally? Are you heads down for parts of the day? Do you have dedicated &ldquo;help_review others&rdquo; time or does it happen ad-hoc?</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This is an interesting question, so here are the answers.</p>
<h2 id="checking-email--slack">Checking email / Slack</h2>
<p>I approach these two differently. Email is something I check only when I don’t have any other task or when I’m in a break. I don’t have alerts or notifications when a new email arrives, so it’s a task that only happens in an active way. I consider email as the best asynchronous communication tool available, thus I treat it that way. I’ve several different filters that labels or archives emails as they arrive so when I check them I don’t have to lose precious time triaging everything that I’ve received.</p>
<p>Of course working 100% asynchronously is an utopia when working in a team that interacts with an external customer, so synchronous communication is a must; at work we use Slack for this. I’ve enabled notifications although I’ve also muted several channels that only generate noise or are mostly for announcements. I could leave those muted channels, however they are still important and I check them a few times throughout the day, usually after catching up with email.</p>
<p>I try to be conscious of how much affects others when mentioning them on Slack, so I try to keep usage of <code>@here</code> at a minimum, <code>@channel</code> only when it is <strong>urgent or very important</strong>; using <code>@everyone</code> is completely off the table, unless a catastrophe happens.
And when it comes to direct messages I always try to send initially only one message: a greeting plus whatever question or comment I’d like to communicate; this way the other person can quickly decide to dedicate some time to me or not.</p>
<h2 id="code-reviews">Code reviews</h2>
<p>A big part of my day consists of reviewing pull requests created by other members of the team. I’m not going to go into the details of how you should behave when doing PR reviews, there are already hundred of posts dedicated to that: this is how I approach this task, YMMV.</p>
<p>First I start by reading the title and description. If those are good and informative then I’d approach the review in a better mood: good programming is mostly about communication, so I held prose to the same standards as code.</p>
<p>Second I look at each commit individually. Writing clear and well scoped commits makes reviewing easier, as you can better understand the author’s intentions. PRs with just one or two gigantic commits are a bummer and from time to time I try and teach people to write smaller commits next time.</p>
<p>Last but not least I look at the code in detail. The first things I look for is overall structure: is the code properly indented or doesn’t violate the rules and standards set for the project? Then I look at the semantics, trying to understand each decision, expecting to see well named variables and methods, easy to follow flow control statements, etc. I can be very nit picky at times, so I have to keep me at bay of not becoming an asshole. And yet there are times when you need to become one; luckily is not something that I need to do often.</p>
<p>PR reviewing is an opportunity for both the author and the reviewer’s growth as programmers and communicators. Treat it like as a learning experience and not as a chore.</p>
<h2 id="time-management">Time management</h2>
<p>With the current pandemic my working conditions changed quite a bit, even when I was already working remotely. The biggest change was on time management. When I worked from my office, I had some dedicated time for things like checking emails and Slack, for deeply diving into any tasks I was working on, and for reviewing code. Now those dedicated time chunks are gone, so I try to manage my time as follows:</p>
<ul>
<li>Checking emails and Slack is something I do first thing in the morning, before and after lunch, and during any coffee- or cigarette-break;</li>
<li>Working on assigned tasks in 20 minutes chunks. Nowadays is hard to find long stretch hours of work, 20 minutes is a good compromise between <em>I want to do something</em> and <em>gonna check the kids, have a break</em>.</li>
<li>PR reviews: I usually do them after the above mentioned 20 minutes. In the past I also scheduled this way, but after 40 minutes/1 hour instead.</li>
<li>Lunchtime is something I’ve cleared out in my calendar, daily from noon to 1pm, so we have some routine for the kids. This I try to keep on schedule, so it doesn’t conflicts with my calendar. Of course it doesn’t always happens but so far it hasn’t been a problem.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="endnotes">Endnotes</h2>
<p>As you can see I haven’t shared any truth revealing insights, though I hope it helps others getting more organized. This schema works for me; it might work for you or don’t work at all.</p>

  <section class="content">
    <p>Last week I was tasked with migrating a DNS zone from DNSimple to AWS Route53. Overall it was pretty straightforward except when I had to migrate two <code>ALIAS</code> records. This is a special type of record that’s not part of the DNS specification, so there was no direct alternative.</p>
<h2 id="subdomain">Subdomain</h2>
<p>Say that you have a subdomain <code>www.example.com</code> that was using an <code>ALIAS</code> record pointing to <code>www.example.net</code>. This is by far the easiest to move, as it implies replacing the <code>TXT</code> record defining the alias for a <code>CNAME</code>.</p>
<h2 id="apex-domain">Apex domain</h2>
<p>This is were it gets complicated. If you had an <code>ALIAS</code> for <code>example.com</code> to <code>example.net</code> you cannot replace it with a <code>CNAME</code>, because apex domains do not support that. The solution is to use an <code>A</code> record, which loses the value of an alias you would need to keep updating the IP address of the destination of it ever changes.</p>
<h2 id="summary">Summary</h2>
<p>As you can see it’s not that complicated to migrate ALIAS records to AWS Route53, however, they do have some limitations. I’ve went from this</p>
<pre tabindex="0"><code>www.example.com. 3600 IN TXT &quot;ALIAS for example.net&quot;
example.com.     3600 IN TXT &quot;ALIAS for example.net&quot;
</code></pre><p>to this</p>
<pre tabindex="0"><code>www.example.com.    3600    IN  CNAME   example.net.
example.net.        3600    IN  A       192.168.14.52
</code></pre><p>and achieved the expected results, though we now need to keep an eye on the IP address of the destination.</p>

  <section class="content">
    <p>I&rsquo;ve joined <del>Citrusbyte</del><a href="https://theorem.co/">Theorem</a> 9 years ago, and since day 1 it was a fully remote experience. Over the years I&rsquo;ve learned lots about how to organize myself to approach each new workday although never gave much thought to it, until a few days ago, when while interviewing a candidate he asked <em>what does a typical day at Theorem looks like</em>. This post will try to address that question.</p>
<p>First and foremost, a disclaimer: by no means I speak on behalf of Theorem or the rest of my teammates; these are entirely my own experiences and do not reflect the reality of all the great people working at this company.</p>
<p>I live with my girlfriend and our two lovely kids (4 years old and 1 year and a half), so keep that in mind while reading this post.</p>
<p>As you are aware, at the time of writing this post we are living in very strange times, throughout a global pandemic that has most of the world in quarantine with people confined to their places and working remotely. As stated earlier, at Theorem we are 100% remote since the beginning, so the COVID-19 pandemic didn&rsquo;t change much on how we work, although it had some effects.</p>
<h2 id="pre-pandemic-typical-workday">Pre-pandemic typical workday</h2>
<p>I have an office 20 blocks away from home, and my kids went to kindergarten 4 blocks away from the office, so days started at 6:15 am to enjoy breakfast with the family, then we would drive the kids to school, drop them and head to the office. My workdays usually started, then, at 8:00 am.</p>
<figure class="photo"><a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/inkel/49831040487/in/dateposted/"><img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/49831040487_a6ce2c02ea.jpg"/></a><figcaption>
            <h4>Office</h4>
        </figcaption>
</figure>

<p>The very first thing I usually do any given day is going through my emails and any pending notification from the day before. If something requires my attention immediately I answer right at it, otherwise, I either archive or snooze the message to a later time if required.</p>
<p>Next is checking the status of any ongoing task I have been working previously, and paving the way for what&rsquo;s next. Then, off to work.</p>
<p>Around noon either myself or my girlfriend goes to pick up the kids from school, and takes them home to have lunch, and then back to the office. If I&rsquo;m the one picking them, I do that during my lunch break, and then have a quick bite or snack. Otherwise, I cook something for myself or order some delivery. During this break I might read or watch something.</p>
<p>Then the rest of the day goes on, until 4:00 pm or 5:00 pm, depending on the day, and walk back home. And that concludes a typical workday.</p>
<h2 id="typical-workday-during-the-pandemic">Typical workday during the pandemic</h2>
<p>Things have changed, clearly. We don&rsquo;t wake up anymore at 6:15 am, now it&rsquo;s usually at around 8:00 am. Breakfast is served, and I use this time to catch up on some news and go through my emails and notifications, again snoozing for an hour or so whatever needs my attention; the rest is archived.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve set up a standing desk in my bedroom, which is right next to the living room, where the kids spend most of their time playing. The biggest change since the pandemic was that nowadays I don&rsquo;t have long stretches of work time anymore, so I try and split my tasks into smaller time schedules, so I can take a look at my kids, play with them or help them with homework (yes, even my 1.5 years old daughter has Zoom meetings now.)</p>

    <h4>Working from home with kids</h4>
  </figcaption>
</figure>
<p>Lunch and dinner are usually planned the night before, so at around noon either me or my girlfriend starts preparing lunch. The kids love this time as they get to watch something on Netflix. I had to cancel all my meetings during this time, but that doesn&rsquo;t seem to have affected my work. Asynchronous communication works great!</p>
<p>After lunch work continues, and I might be able to get some work-only hours if the kids decide to nap, otherwise, again it&rsquo;s split into smaller chunks of time. Either way, I&rsquo;m still able to drive my commitments to success.</p>
<h2 id="conclusions">Conclusions</h2>
<p>As you can see, not much has changed, other than how many hours in stretch I can work without interruptions. All other work details were already in place given that we are a 100% remote company. The biggest takeaway, for me, is that in order to survive this crazy new world we are living in, you need to work with great people, who understand not all experiences are equal, who trust you will work with professionalism and responsibility, and who you trust back in the same way.</p>

    <p>If you are like me you might have used the <a href="https://linux.die.net/man/1/sort"><code>sort(1)</code></a> CLI utility more than once in your life. Today, I&rsquo;ve found a trick that I&rsquo;ve never used before, and hopefully it will help someone else in the future.</p>
<p>Say that we have the following file to sort:</p>
<pre tabindex="0"><code>fpdy 01 08 wcfo
juvi 01 02 ejan
urbx 04 03 ckbw
fkzq 01 08 myaz
fjie 04 09 rhvo
almv 04 02 adhs
cuah 07 04 gbyt
chok 09 06 nqwo
emjd 01 04 ledx
npto 02 10 nqsc
</code></pre><p>Now, supposed that I wanted to sort first by the third column and then for the second one, then one would do <code>sort -k 3 foo.txt</code>. Easy. But what if instead the source file looked like this and I wanted the same results?</p>
<pre tabindex="0"><code>fpdy 0108 wcfo
juvi 0102 ejan
urbx 0403 ckbw
fkzq 0108 myaz
fjie 0409 rhvo
almv 0402 adhs
cuah 0704 gbyt
chok 0906 nqwo
emjd 0104 ledx
npto 0210 nqsc
</code></pre><p>Well, tricky, right? Not really: the <code>-k</code> accepts the format <code>F[.C]</code>, where <code>F</code> is the field number (<code>2</code> in our case) and <code>C</code> is the character position within the field (<code>4</code> in our case) so if we run the following we will achieve what we are looking for:</p>

    <p>If there&rsquo;s one piece of technology I&rsquo;ve come to love and depend upon these last years it definitely is <a href="https://www.terraform.io/">Terraform</a>. Sadly, the only provider that seems to be complete is the <a href="https://www.terraform.io/docs/providers/aws/index.html">AWS provider</a>, but others seems to be missing some useful resources or data sources. As an example, these past days at <a href="https://www.citrusbyte.com/">work</a> I had to work with the <a href="https://www.terraform.io/docs/providers/azurerm/index.html">Azure provider</a> and found that I was really missing the ability to query <a href="https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/">Azure</a> for <a href="https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/services/virtual-machines/">Virtual Machine</a> IDs, but there wasn&rsquo;t a data source for this, and I didn&rsquo;t want to <a href="https://www.terraform.io/docs/import/index.html">import</a> the virtual machines we&rsquo;ve already created (insert <em>long story</em> reasons here).</p>
<p>But then I remember that Terraform and its providers are written in <a href="https://golang.org/">Go</a>, so I took it to add the resource myself.</p>
<p>This post isn&rsquo;t about how to write providers, the folks at Hashicorp already wrote a guide to <a href="https://www.terraform.io/docs/extend/writing-custom-providers.html">write custom providers</a> which is pretty useful. But I&rsquo;ve found that there was something missing, or that I didn&rsquo;t fully understood, and that was <em>how can I test my changes are working?</em>.</p>
<p>Most if not all providers have unit and acceptance tests that allow to test that the changes we introduced work as expected, which are great for once you want to send a pull request, but I am the type of programmer that likes to try things in the <em>Real World™</em> before going into the TDD workflow, so I fired up my editor and start hacking on adding a new data source that would allow me to query a virtual machine ID by name. After a few tries, I&rsquo;ve got something that looked about right, but then the question came: how do I test it? If I run <code>terraform init</code> it uses the published provider, which obviously doesn&rsquo;t have the changes I made. I&rsquo;ve found in the documentation some references as to where can you place <a href="https://www.terraform.io/docs/configuration/providers.html#third-party-plugins">third-party providers</a> on your machine for testing, but that didn&rsquo;t really work as it was missing, IMO, some information. Luckily, I&rsquo;ve found some pointers in another document that explains how <a href="https://www.terraform.io/docs/extend/how-terraform-works.html#discovery">Terraform works</a>, but that was still missing some information. After a while, I&rsquo;ve found the solution, and here it is:</p>
<ul>
<li>Git clone <a href="https://github.com/terraform-providers/terraform-provider-azurerm">Azure Terraform provider source code</a>.</li>
<li>Make the changes.</li>
<li>Run <code>go build</code>. This will generate a <code>terraform-provider-azurerm</code> executable in your current directory.</li>
<li>Move the executable to the discovery folder: <code>mv terraform-provider-azurerm ~/.terraform.d/plugins/darwin_amd64/</code></li>
<li>Go to a folder with some Terraform configuration that uses the Azure provider.</li>
<li>Remove the cached version: <code>rm -rv .terraform/plugins/</code> (this will remove all plugins, but don&rsquo;t worry)</li>
<li>Run <code>terraform init</code></li>
<li>Profit!</li>
</ul>
<p>Now I can test my changes with a live Terraform configuration.</p>

    <p>I&rsquo;ve came across the following tweet the other day, and I couldn&rsquo;t be more excited:</p>
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet"><p lang="en" dir="ltr"><a href="https://t.co/P3BbFqx1ro">https://t.co/P3BbFqx1ro</a> CURLOPT_HAPROXYPROTOCOL: support the HAProxy PROXY protocol<br><br>Add --haproxy-protocol for the command line tool<br><br>Cl...</p>&mdash; curl commits (@curlcommits) <a href="https://twitter.com/curlcommits/status/974961166807109633?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">March 17, 2018</a></blockquote>
<script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script>

<p>This is exciting to me as the work I&rsquo;ve been doing in <a href="https://github.com/inkel/viaproxy"><code>viaproxy</code></a> had one caveat: testing it works was a bit convoluted, as I was doing by running an <a href="https://www.haproxy.org/">HAProxy</a> instance with a custom configuration like the following:</p>
<pre tabindex="0"><code>global
    debug
    maxconn 4000
    log 127.0.0.1 local0

defaults
    timeout connect 10s
    timeout client  1m
    timeout server  1m

listen without-send-proxy
    mode tcp
    log global
    option tcplog
    bind *:17654
    server app1 127.0.0.1:7655

listen with-send-proxy
    mode tcp
    log global
    option tcplog
    bind *:27654
    bind ipv6@:27654
    server app1 127.0.0.1:7654 send-proxy
</code></pre><p>Luckily commit <a href="https://github.com/curl/curl/commit/6baeb6df35d24740c55239f24b5fc4ce86f375a5"><code>6baeb6df</code></a> adds a new <code>--haproxy-protocol</code> that, as documented, will do the following:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Send a HAProxy PROXY protocol header at the beginning of the connection. This is used by some load balancers and reverse proxies to indicate the client&rsquo;s true IP address and port.</p>
<p>This option is primarily useful when sending test requests to a service that expects this header.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Reading the commit changes is very enlightening, too, as it is a great example of nice and simple C code. I&rsquo;m looking forward to the release!</p>

<p>After a brief exchange of tweets, I said:</p>
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">Or we could write one in Go 😺</p>&mdash; Lean (inkel) (@inkel) <a href="https://twitter.com/inkel/status/923896402056499200?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">October 27, 2017</a></blockquote>

<p>Twenty minutes later <a href="https://github.com/inkel/lruc"><code>lruc</code></a> was born.</p>

<p>It&rsquo;s still very fresh and missing many features, but basically it is a web server that allows you to configure it to always respond with a custom response without too much hassle. The usage is very simple:</p>
<pre tabindex="0"><code>Usage of lruc:
  -addr string
        Address to listen for requests (default &quot;:8080&quot;)
  -body -
        Response body. Use - to read from a stdin (default &quot;Hello, World!&quot;)
  -code int
        HTTP response code (default 200)
  -content-type string
        Content-Type (default &quot;text/plain&quot;)
</code></pre><p>Say that you want to create a server that always respond with a <code>404 Not Found</code> and a body of <code>No se pudo encontrar lo que buscaba</code> (Spanish for <em>Couldn&rsquo;t find what you were looking for</em> (sort of)) on port 7070, then you could execute the following:</p>
<pre tabindex="0"><code>lruc -addr :7070 -code 404 -body &quot;No se pudo encontrar lo que buscaba&quot;
</code></pre><p>Or say that you want to always return an image, then you could do something like:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre tabindex="0" class="chroma"><code class="language-sh" data-lang="sh">&lt; image.png lruc -content-type image/png -body -

<span class="c1"># Or in an useless use of cat</span>
cat image.png <span class="p">|</span> lruc -content-type image/png -body -
</code></pre></div><p>This seems like an interesting tool to keep working on, so watch <a href="https://github.com/inkel/lruc"><code>github.com/inkel/lruc</code></a> for updates.</p>
<p>PS: did I said already that I love Go?</p>

    <p>Ever happened to you that you wanted to know which SSH key you need to connect to an AWS EC2 instance? I always found that the fingerprints don&rsquo;t tell me much, espcially because I always forget how to compute the fingerprints. Good that I&rsquo;m back to writing, so I&rsquo;m dumping my memory here:</p>
<ul>
<li>if the key was generated by AWS, then use <code>openssl pkcs8 -in path/to/key.pem -nocrypt -topk8 -outform DER | openssl sha1 -c</code></li>
<li>if the key was generated using <code>ssh-keygen</code> then use <code>openssl rsa -in path/to/private/key -pubout -outform DER | openssl md5 -c</code></li>

<p>Why does AWS uses one format and why SSH other? Escapes my current knowledge.</p>

<p>In my <a href="/posts/proxy-protocol/">previous article</a> I introduced a repository that hold the code to create <code>net.Conn</code> objects aware of the <a href="http://www.haproxy.com/blog/haproxy/proxy-protocol/">proxy protocol</a>, but I wasn&rsquo;t happy with the name of the repository.</p>
<p>Package names are important in Go, and one aspect that we tend to overlook is that they actually are part of the calling signature when you want to use an export type or function. With the previous code, if we wanted to use the <code>net.Conn</code> wrapper we would have to first import the library:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre tabindex="0" class="chroma"><code class="language-go" data-lang="go"><span class="kn">import</span> <span class="s">&#34;github.com/inkel/go-proxy-protocol/conn&#34;</span>
</code></pre></div><p>Once we did that, then to wrap a connection we would have to call:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre tabindex="0" class="chroma"><code class="language-go" data-lang="go"><span class="nx">newCn</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="nx">err</span> <span class="o">:=</span> <span class="nx">conn</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="nf">WithProxyProtocol</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="nx">cn</span><span class="p">)</span>
</code></pre></div><p>Similarly if we wanted to use the <code>net.Listen</code> alternative, we should&rsquo;ve had to import <code>github.com/inkel/go-proxy-protocol/listen</code> and then call <code>cn, err := listen.WithProxyProtocol</code>. This doesn&rsquo;t look right to my eyes, and hopefully not to yours either. And aside aesthetics, two packages for such limited code? Doesn&rsquo;t make much sense.</p>
<p>So I spent the day thinking on a better name that could allow me to better convey the effect we want to achieve and that fits in just one library, and thus, <a href="github.com/inkel/viaproxy"><code>github.com/inkel/viaproxy</code></a> came to be. Let&rsquo;s see how better the code would look like now when wrapping a connection:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre tabindex="0" class="chroma"><code class="language-go" data-lang="go"><span class="c1">// import the package
</span><span class="c1"></span><span class="kn">import</span> <span class="s">&#34;github.com/inkel/viaproxy&#34;</span>

<span class="c1">// wrap the connection
</span><span class="c1"></span><span class="nx">newCn</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="nx">err</span> <span class="o">:=</span> <span class="nx">viaproxy</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="nf">Wrap</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="nx">cn</span><span class="p">)</span>
</code></pre></div><p>Similarly if you want to use the <code>net.Listener</code>, the code looks just as well (and I might even add that looks better):</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre tabindex="0" class="chroma"><code class="language-go" data-lang="go"><span class="c1">// import the package
</span><span class="c1"></span><span class="kn">import</span> <span class="s">&#34;github.com/inkel/viaproxy&#34;</span>

<span class="c1">// create the listener
</span><span class="c1"></span><span class="nx">ln</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="nx">err</span> <span class="o">:=</span> <span class="nx">viaproxy</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="nf">Listen</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="s">&#34;tcp&#34;</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="s">&#34;:1234&#34;</span><span class="p">)</span>

    <p>Today I became aware of the <a href="http://www.haproxy.com/blog/haproxy/proxy-protocol/">proxy protocol</a>.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The Proxy Protocol was designed to chain proxies / reverse-proxies without losing the client information.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>If you are proxying an HTTP(S) server, chances are that you have used the <code>X-Forwarded-From</code> header to keep the real remote address of the client making the request and not receving the proxy&rsquo;s address instead. But this only works for HTTP(S): if you are proxying any other kind of TCP service, you are doomed.</p>
<p>Take for instance the following example: we will have a simple TCP server that echo backs the client&rsquo;s remote address:</p>

<p>I&rsquo;m running <code>go run server.go</code> in a machine whose IP is <code>192.168.1.20</code>, and I&rsquo;ll be sending requests from another machine whose IP is <code>192.168.1.12</code>. One the server machine I&rsquo;m also running an <a href="HAProxy">https://www.haproxy.org/</a> server that acts as a proxy to the Go program above:</p>
<pre tabindex="0"><code>global
    debug
    maxconn 4000
    log 127.0.0.1 local0

defaults
    timeout connect 10s
    timeout client  1m
    timeout server  1m

listen wo-send-proxy
    mode tcp
    log global
    option tcplog
    bind *:17654
    server app1 192.168.1.20:7654

listen w-send-proxy
    mode tcp
    log global
    option tcplog
    bind *:27654
    server app1 192.168.1.20:7654 send-proxy
</code></pre><p>This configuration creates 2 proxies: one listening on port <code>17654</code> which just proxies the client connection to the server, and another proxy listening in port <code>276564</code> which does the same but it also enables using the proxy protocol by using the <a href="http://cbonte.github.io/haproxy-dconv/1.7/configuration.html#send-proxy"><code>send-proxy</code></a> keyword.</p>
<p>On the client machine, I&rsquo;m running the following to send requests directly to the Go server, via the regular proxy and via the proxy with proxy protocol enabled:</p>
<pre tabindex="0"><code>$ for port in {,1,2}7654; do echo inkel | nc 192.168.1.20 ${port}; done
Your remote address is 192.168.1.12:44966
Your remote address is 192.168.1.20:57680
Your remote address is 192.168.1.20:57681
</code></pre><p>As you can see in the first case the client is informed that its remote address is <code>192.168.1.12</code>, which is correct, but in both the other cases it says <code>192.168.1.20</code>, which is the address of the proxy. Let&rsquo;s check what the server has to say in its output:</p>
<pre tabindex="0"><code>$ go run server.go
2017/10/13 11:50:54 handling connection from 192.168.1.12:44966
2017/10/13 11:50:54 client sent 6 bytes: &quot;inkel\n&quot;

2017/10/13 11:50:54 handling connection from 192.168.1.20:57681
2017/10/13 11:50:54 client sent 56 bytes: &quot;PROXY TCP4 192.168.1.12 192.168.1.20 58472 27654\r\ninkel\n&quot;
</code></pre><p>Here something interesting happens: the first connection, the one made directly to the Go server, properly shows the remote address as <code>192.168.1.12</code> and the contents. The second and third ones incorrectly report the remote address as <code>192.168.1.20</code> but the third one shows something interesting in what was received from the client: instead of just receiving <code>inkel</code> it first received <code>PROXY TCP4 192.168.1.12 192.168.1.20 58472 27654\r\n</code>. This is what proxy protocol does, and if you see clearly, the client&rsquo;s actual IP address is there!</p>
<p>The proxy protocol, when enabled, will send the following initial line to the proxied server:</p>
<pre tabindex="0"><code>PROXY &lt;inet protocol&gt; &lt;client IP&gt; &lt;proxy IP&gt; &lt;client port&gt; &lt;proxy port&gt;\r\n
</code></pre><p>The actual <a href="http://www.haproxy.org/download/1.8/doc/proxy-protocol.txt">specification</a> is fairly simple, and now we can see why the only condition for proxy protocol to work is that <strong>both endpoints of the connection MUST be compatible with proxy protocol</strong>.</p>
<p>This explains why the Go server isn&rsquo;t reporting the right remote address, even when proxy protocol is used: the <a href="https://golang.org/pkg/net/"><code>net</code></a> package doesn&rsquo;t (currently) supports proxy protocol. But adding support to it isn&rsquo;t too difficult. Here we have a custom connection type that complies with the <a href="https://golang.org/pkg/net/#Conn"><code>net.Conn</code></a> interface:</p>

    <p>So here I am, once more, trying to have some sort of blog or journal. I&rsquo;ll try to write about interesting pieces of code that I&rsquo;ve written, problems I had to solve, books I&rsquo;ve read (or dropped), et cetera. Don&rsquo;t get your hopes too high, though, I&rsquo;m lazy and tend to forget doing this kind of stuff.</p>
